# 👋 Hi there, I'm Roullito!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
🎓 I'm currently enrolled at **Holberton School**, diving deep into low-level programming with C and preparing to become a fullstack developer. From command-line tools to system-level code, I'm building a strong foundation to specialize later in **systems, blockchain, cybersecurity**, or **AI/Machine Learning**.
